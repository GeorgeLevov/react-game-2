# SPEED TYPER

A fun game where you have to type out as many words as possible in 10 seconds!

The app utilizes different React features mentioned below:

-   Controlled component managed by React State hook,
-   Custom Hook, to separate business logic and help with code readability and reusability
-   Persistent reference to the input enabled by React useRef hook
-   The useEffect hook manages the time logic as well as the game cycles through state

A deployed version of the app can be found <a href="https://react-speed-typer.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here</a>
